      <h3>Noriyuki Suzuki &nbsp;| &nbsp;鈴木 紀之</h3>
      <p>
        Noriyuki Suzuki (b. 1985, Fukushima, Japan) is an artist based in
        Bremen. Working across photography, sound, language, and installation,
        his practice engages with the concept of defamiliarization, inspired by
        the Japanese experimental photography movement of the 1960s and Viktor
        Shklovsky’s formalist approach. Since relocating to Germany in 2014, he
        has explored ways to transform ordinary objects, colors, and daily
        rituals into new perspectives. By shifting perception, he reveals
        overlooked details of everyday life and invites reflection on what often
        goes unnoticed.
