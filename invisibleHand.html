            Invisible Hand is a kinetic sculpture that symbolizes the Japanese
            execution chamber used for the death penalty, a practice still in
            place and carried out more than 700 times since the Second World
            War. Executions are conducted by three executioners pressing
            separate buttons simultaneously to trigger the hanging. Only one
            button is connected and the others are dummies intended to lessen
            the executioners’ sense of guilt by obscuring who actually initiated
            the act. This deliberate anonymity reflects a modern anxiety toward
            committing to certain actions: in technologically advanced
            societies, people often evade responsibility by concealing the
            agency of an act through machines or instruments and by distancing
            themselves from its consequences. In the work, two witch brooms
            collide within a cloth-covered metal-framed structure, enacting an
            execution performed by an invisible hand, a magical intervention
            whose origin is unknown. Just as the death chamber is hidden behind
            a wall so the executioners cannot see the act or connect it with
            their own gesture, the installation’s white cloth isolates and
            alienates the space from the external human world.

            Although the exact origin of the three-button system is unclear, it
            echoes the blank cartridge method used in military executions during
            the First and Second World Wars in various countries. In those
            cases, one member of a firing squad was issued a blank cartridge to
            create the possibility that they did not kill the condemned and to
            soften the psychological burden. The idea is that uncertainty might
            comfort the executioner, at least in theory. In Japan, judicial
            hanging was officially devised in 1873 at the start of the Meiji era
            and formally adopted in 1880, during a period of radical political
            and social transformation as the country opened to the Western
            world. The new penal code designed the scaffold for hanging, and to
            this day only hanging is permitted for capital punishment. The law
            defines it as follows:

            Specifically, the floor on which the person to be executed is
            standing is opened and the person falls. The rope around the neck
            causes death under the person’s own weight (step-board opening and

            After WWII, Japan enacted a new constitution under the Allied
            occupation but did not abolish the death penalty, as the Allies
            themselves retained it. While many countries, especially in Europe,
            have abolished capital punishment, nearly 80% of the Japanese public
            continues to support its use (Based on the survey conducted between
            2004 ~ 2019).

            A condemned person never knows the exact date of their execution. On
            the day itself, they are taken from solitary confinement without
            warning, escorted to a chaplaincy room where sutras are read before
            a Buddha statue, then led into the execution chamber. They are
            handcuffed, their legs bound, blindfolded, and a rope placed around
            the neck. After being asked for any final words, a light signals the
            moment, the buttons are pressed, and the footboard opens. The
            executioners never see the act, as a wall separates the button room
            from the chamber. Five minutes after death is confirmed, the body is
            lowered, placed in a coffin, and removed. The anonymity of the act,
            built into the chamber’s architecture, serves multiple purposes. It
            may help those involved reconcile with their participation,
            reinforcing the perception that “the execution cannot be helped”
            since the doer is unidentifiable. It separates punishment from the
            appearance of interpersonal killing, allowing the law to claim that
            justice is carried out by an impersonal mechanism. In truth, the
            only physical force that completes the execution is gravity acting
            on the condemned’s own body weight, excluding any other direct human
            intervention. The executioners send their signal in the hope that
            they are not Connected. To carry out the death penalty in a state
            where heinous murder is punishable by death produces a paradoxical,
            almost schizophrenic twist.

            In criminal law, two concepts measure culpability: actus reus
            (guilty act) and mens rea (guilty mind), established in Edward
            Coke’s Institute of the Laws of England in the 17th century. His
            principle actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea (“an act does not
            make a person guilty unless the mind is also guilty”) states that a
            crime requires both the act and the intent to occur together. Common
            sense distinguishes accidental acts from intentional ones: bumping
            into someone in a crowded train differs from deliberately colliding
            in an empty carriage. Responsibility arises only when intention is
            present, formed, and controllable. We do not resent a crying
            newborn, knowing the behavior is natural and beyond intent.
            Similarly, people with severe mental disorders may not be held
            culpable. This shows that recognizing guilt presupposes a boundary
            between human agency and uncontrollable natural forces and
            paradoxically, punishment assumes the criminal is a fully capable
            human being, just as one must believe in witchcraft to accuse a
            witch.

            In today’s technologically advanced society, countless interfaces
            and communication tools transmit intentions across distances.
            Actions and consequences are increasingly separated and unobservable
            to their originators. One can harm systems or people remotely,
            through cyberattacks or unmanned aerial vehicles, without direct
            confrontation. Autonomous systems, such as artificial intelligence,
            classify and filter information without visible human oversight. In
            each case, only the outcome is apparent and the proactive human
            presence is concealed.

            Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”, originally tied to market
            self-regulation, here extends to institutional and technological
            systems that obscure responsibility. Marx critiqued capitalism for
            alienating laborers from the products of their work, stripping them
            of intent and connection. The three-button execution method
            functions similarly, alienating executioners from the act of killing
            even as they initiate it. They act while hoping not to be directly
            connected. It also warns of the danger that modern states or
            powerful organizations might exploit machines and advanced
            technology as an invisible hand, avoiding accountability by erasing
            the subject from view. As processes become increasingly complex and
            interconnected, there is a growing risk of forgetting the human
            presence behind them, the only presence capable of taking
            responsibility.
