            Anima is an installation that recreates my recorded heartbeats
            through six glasses of water, controlled and played in loops by a
            microcontroller. Each glass corresponds to a sequence of heartbeats,
            producing a rhythmic, physical expression of my pulse.

          <p>
            The title comes from the Latin word anima, meaning “life,” “soul,”
            or “breath,” from which the word “animation” originates. In its
            earliest sense, animation meant “the act of imparting life.” This
            work transfers my breath, via digital systems, into a non-organic
            substance—effectively “cursing” or hacking the objects in a binary,
            mechanical way. The result is a primitive instrument that moves
            water back and forth, while referencing my own life log. In this
            sense, the object becomes possessed by my anima, serving as a kind
            of physical avatar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ways in which we preserve ourselves may become increasingly
            complex—digital clones able to exist indefinitely in virtual
            environments, or DNA information embedded in trees. Such
            possibilities suggest the emergence of a new form of animism, one in
            which existence is no longer tied to the physical body. This vision
            of persistence beyond bodily life may feel more primitive, or even
            more religious, than today’s dominant religions.
