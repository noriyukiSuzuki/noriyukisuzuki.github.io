            A history dreams is a film work documenting a performance in which
            eight historical timelines are randomly selected from Wikipedia’s
            “List of Timelines” page, which contained 594 timelines as of April
            2018. Using the Wikipedia API, all sentences from each chosen
            timeline are collected. A new timeline is then generated using a
            Markov chain algorithm based on the gathered texts. This newly
            created text appears on screen and is repeatedly written down by
            hand. The work was inspired by a passage from philosopher and
            logician Willard Van Orman Quine, who described our inherited
            knowledge as a fabric woven from fact and convention, continually
            revised by human perception and interpretation.

            develops and changes, through more or less arbitrary and deliberate
            revisions and additions of our own, more or less directly occasioned
            by the continuing stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale grey
            lore, black with fact and white with convention. But I have found no
            substantial reasons for concluding that there are any quite black
            threads in it, or any white ones.</em

            The work questions the very possibility of “history,” not in terms
            of fairness, accuracy, or authorship, but in its selective
            construction. Which events are integrated into history depends on
            ethical perspectives and spatiotemporal contexts, shaped by
            ideologies that prioritize certain narratives over others. History
            does not exist naturally; it is an assemblage of words arranged to
            fit specific contexts. Just as one cannot insert planetary formation
            into the history of the French Revolution, or health insurance into
            the history of Zionism, the logic of context dictates historical
            inclusion. The Markov-generated timelines reveal not a jumble of
            events but a linguistic dissonance, highlighting history as a
            textual, rather than purely factual, construct.

            Modern education tends to present history as centralized and
            authoritative, something to be learned rather than investigated. Yet
            as shown by the diversity of timelines on Wikipedia, perspectives
            are multiplying. Alternative histories—such as timelines of LGBT
            history or women’s legal rights—challenge fixed narratives. As
            Benedetto Croce observed, “All history is contemporary history”; it
            is constantly overwritten in light of current ideologies.

            With the rise of the internet, the nature of record-keeping has
            changed dramatically. Social media generates vast personal archives
            of text, images, and videos, often without historical framing, yet
            potentially influential in future narratives. As the digital archive
            expands, we edge toward “a society that has already recorded
            everything.” This accumulation produces a “super-diversity” of
            potential histories alongside inevitable gaps in understanding. The
            question remains: will this lead to a fragmented world divided by
            conflicting narratives, or a society where individuals can construct
            their own optimized histories?
