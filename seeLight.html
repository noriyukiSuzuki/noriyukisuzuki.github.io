            See the Light is a light installation that uses eye-blink detection
            to illuminate only when someone in front of the camera closes their
            eyes. This interaction creates a paradox: to activate the light, one
            must close their eyes, but doing so prevents them from seeing it.
            Only an observer standing outside the interaction can witness the
            light. However, if this observer approaches to engage with the
            installation, they too must close their eyes, losing sight of the
            light. The work highlights the interplay between action and
            perception, underscoring the inherent tension between experience and
            observation. When only the light and a single participant are
            present, the light remains unseen, emphasizing the relational
            dynamics of seeing, absence, and presence. See the Light invites
            viewers to contemplate the boundaries of perception and the shared
            yet elusive nature of light and interaction.
