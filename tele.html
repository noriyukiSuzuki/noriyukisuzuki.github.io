            tele- is an installation that generates continuous feedback noise by
            directly connecting two telephone receivers. One receiver plays the
            word “Hello?”, which is digitally recorded by the other and played
            back in an endless loop, forming a closed circuit reminiscent of the
            ouroboros, the serpent consuming its own tail.

            The title comes from the Greek roots of “tele” meaning “distant, far
            off” and “phone” meaning “sound, voice”. While modern smartphones
            far exceed the original purpose of the telephone, the devices used
            here, German FeTAp611-2 and FeTAp612-2 models from the 1960s to
            1980s, served solely to transmit voices between distant locations.
            Since its practical adoption in the late 19th century, the telephone
            has been indispensable in military, commercial, and personal
            communication, removing the time and space barriers inherent in
            mail. Beyond its utility, it has also acquired symbolic weight in
            fiction and film, bridging real and virtual worlds in The Matrix
            (1999), linking life and death in Dial M for Murder (1954), or
            connecting hero and citizen in Batman (1966). The telephone’s power
            to link two entirely separate realms in real time has long lent it a
            metaphoric role as a channel to the transcendent.

            In this work, the greeting “Hello?” which is normally a way to
            confirm the presence of someone on the other end becomes absurd. The
            telephones are linked without human participants, creating an
            exchange where a voice that does not physically exist confirms the
            existence of something equally absent. This futility evokes the
            silent God of religious longing and the believer’s unanswered calls,
            echoing Psalm 83:1: “O God, do not remain silent; do not turn a deaf
            ear, do not stand aloof, O God.” In the last century, communication
            technology has advanced so rapidly that we forget the physical
            distances it was invented to bridge. Devices are now mass-produced
            and increasingly automated. But if automation continues to the point
            where humans themselves are excluded from the loop of communication,
            what kind of interaction or absence will remain?
